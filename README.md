**NadeefChowdhury/NadeefChowdhury** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Hello, everyone. I am Nadeef Muttaqin Chowdhury, a self taught programmer, website developer, data analyst and aspiring roboticist.
Coding has been a passion for me since I was 12. I started learning C after reading an article on programming in a teen magazine one day, and looking back now, it has been one of the best decisions I have made in my life.
I started with basic C programming and I was into robotics since the beginning. I started participating in competitions and by the grace of Almighty, won prizes too. I became interested in data science when I was 15 and switched to python. I learnt the usage of libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib etc for creating machine learning models like Linear Regression and Logistic regression and for data visualization.
Afterwards, I focused on website development
